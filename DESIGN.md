## Hierarchy and layout

The most important message on the page is to make it simple to find and book flights. This will be
presented in the hero section of the page.

The following website elements will be used for the home page:

- Header with navigation
  - Also includes login/sign up with a form.
- Hero section
  - Includes the main content and is the most important for the user.
- Secondary content section
  - Includes suggestions for the user with product cards.
  - Includes user feedback of the website.
- Footer
  - Includes additional information, links and customer logo.

## Images

Images is used to better show the destinations and the airlines. For the hero section, there
is an image used in the background behind a search bar. For the rest of the images used, the
text will be either on the side or below the image. If we chose to put text on top of an image, we
will use a color-overlay to make the text more readable.

## Icons

Icons are used to link to our Github repository and to show partners, such as Visa and Mastercard. 
We have also used icons from [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) where we see fit. This 
is for example stars for feedback, planes for destinations and a person for the user profile.

## Typography

The main font for the website is Montserrat. This is a sans-serif font with rounded edges. This font
is chosen for its clean and simple look. A combination of bold and thin font will be used to create
a hierarchy on the page. Bold will be used for buttons, headers or text that is emphasized. Thin
font will be used for body text.

## Border Rounding

Rounded corners are used to make the website more playful. The corner radius used is between 5-20px.
Smaller boxes will have a smaller radius, while larger boxes will have a larger radius. This is to 
create a hierarchy on the page.

## Shadows

Shadows are used to emphasize elements on the page. This includes the search bar and cards. The 
shadow have the size of 3-5 pixels depending on the size of the object and the background color.
