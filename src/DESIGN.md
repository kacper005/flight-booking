# Design Guidelines

## Concept Phase

### Theme

For the Flight Finder website will have a combination of playfulness and being serious. It will be
playful to appeal to the costumers desire to travel and explore new places, as well as being serious
website our users can trust.

### Color Scheme

The website is designed with a blue color scheme. Blue represents, among others, calmness, peace,
trust and professionalism. This is fitting for a flight booking website, where the user is trusting
the site to find the best flights for them and being trustworthy. Blue also represents the sky and
ocean, which also fits for our travel-oriented website.

### Hierarchy and layout

The most important message on the page is to make it simple to find and book flights. This will be
presented in the hero section of the page.

The following website elements will be used for the home page:

- Header with navigation
  - Also includes login/sign up with a form.
- Hero section
  - Includes the main content and is the most important for the user.
- Secondary content section
  - Includes suggestions for the user with product cards.
- Footer
  - Includes additional information, links and customer logo.

### Images

Images will be used to better show the destinations and the airlines. For the hero section, there
will be an image used in the background behind a search bar. For the rest of the images used, the
text will be either on the side or below the image. If we chose to put text on top of an image, we
will use a color-overlay to make the text more readable.

### Icons

Icons will be used to link to our Github repository and to show partners, such as Visa and
Mastercard. If available, colored icons will be used.

### Typography

The main font for the website is Montserrat. This is a sans-serif font with rounded edges. This font
is chosen for its clean and simple look. A combination of bold and thin font will be used to create
a hierarchy on the page. Bold will be used for buttons, headers or text that is emphasized. Thin
font will be used for body text.

### Border Rounding

Rounded corners will be used to make the website more playful. We will use a corner radius of 10-20.

### Shadows

Shadows will be used to emphasize elements on the page. This includes the search bar and cards. The
default shadow will have the size of 4 pixels
